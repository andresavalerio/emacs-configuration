** Why Emacs?
For those who use Emacs as a daily basis, thats a silly question. Others, however, may never see light in their lives. But there are plenty of reasons for someone to use such a complex tool.

First of all, Emacs is one of the most customizable tools I've ever seen. I can create my cute, colorful and useful environment with Lisp code. It's insane and adorable.

Emacs is more than just a VS Code substitute, is almost an entire operational system by itself. For now, I use only for writting purposes and some Racket codes, but you can use it for a variety of things, from caledar to emails.

Last but not least, Emacs is Free Software. And Free Software is Freedom. I hope you'll find the freedom you need in your machine, in your code and specially in your thought.
